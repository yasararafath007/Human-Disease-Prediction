Contribution:

Data Processing and Exploration: Preprocessing dataset, handling missing values, and exploring symptom and disease distributions.
Model Development: Designing and implementing a neural network model with regularization for improved generalization.
Training and Evaluation: Executing model training, monitoring key metrics, and evaluating performance on a testing set.
Visualizations: Creating insightful visualizations, including histograms and confusion matrices.
Tools Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Outcome:

Trained machine learning model for disease prediction with key metrics and visualizations.
Visualizations aid in understanding data distribution, training progression, and model performance.
Codebase available for exploration and potential deployment in real-world scenarios.
